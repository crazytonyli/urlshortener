Introduction

This is a chrome extension which is used to shorten url.

How to install it

Currently it is not available in [Chrome Web Store], since it is still in development. But you can get the 'crx' file at [package/urlshortener.crx]. Give it a try, hope you like it.

TODO
----
  - Change extension UI.
  - Allow user input url.
